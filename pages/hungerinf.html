            <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; max-width: 80%;">In The Hunger Games, the first book of Suzanne Collins’ dystopian trilogy, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives in Panem, a harsh, totalitarian society divided into districts and ruled by the wealthy Capitol. Each year, as punishment for a past rebellion, the Capitol forces each district to send one boy and one girl to participate in the Hunger Games—a televised fight to the death. When her younger sister Prim is chosen in the lottery, or "Reaping," Katniss volunteers to take her place, knowing it’s likely a death sentence. Along with Peeta Mellark, her district’s male "tribute," Katniss is sent to the Capitol to train, strategize, and ultimately fight for her life in the Games.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; max-width: 80%;">Inside the arena, Katniss relies on her survival skills and sharp instincts, forming alliances and navigating the Games' brutal traps. Peeta, meanwhile, plays on the Capitol audience’s emotions by pretending to be in love with her, making their story more compelling and giving them both a better chance at survival. As the Games progress, Katniss becomes torn between playing along with Peeta’s romance and protecting her own heart and survival. In a climactic twist, Katniss and Peeta threaten to take their own lives rather than kill each other, forcing the Capitol to let them both win. This act of defiance sets off a chain of events that will spark unrest across Panem, as Katniss returns home, uncertain about her feelings for Peeta and the consequences of her rebellion</p>
