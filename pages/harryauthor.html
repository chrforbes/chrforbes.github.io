            <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; max-width: 80%;">J.K. Rowling, born in Yate, England, in 1965, is best known for creating the Harry Potter series. The journey of a young wizard and his battle against dark forces captivated readers of all ages and has established Rowling as one of the most successful authors in modern literature. The first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was made while facing personal hardships, including financial struggles and single motherhood. The series, spanning seven books, achieved unexpected yet massive success, inspiring a blockbuster film franchise, theme parks, and a variety of spin-offs, making Rowling an influential figure in both literary and popular culture.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; max-width: 80%;">Beyond Harry Potter, Rowling has continued to write under the name Robert Galbraith for her crime fiction series, the Cormoran Strike novels, which help to showcase her versatility. Despite her literary success, Rowling has sparked significant controversy due to her disputed views on social and political issues, particularly gender identity, which has tarnished her huge reputation. Her influence as a writer and public figure remains substantial though, sparking discussions around her legacy, her creative contributions, and the impact of authors on public discourse.</p>
