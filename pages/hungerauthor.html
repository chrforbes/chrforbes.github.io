            <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; max-width: 80%;">Suzanne Collins, born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1962, is an American author best known for The Hunger Games trilogy, a dystopian series that set a new standard for young adult literature. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where children are forced into a brutal televised deathmatch, The Hunger Games explores themes of survival, power, and sacrifice, resonating deeply with readers and sparking discussions on social inequality and authoritarianism. The series, which includes Catching Fire and Mockingjay, became an international phenomenon, inspiring a successful film franchise and establishing new expectations for science fiction as a genre.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; max-width: 80%;">Before The Hunger Games, Collins had a background in children’s television and had written The Underland Chronicles, a fantasy series that delves into themes of war and empathy. Her television work and earlier writing heavily influenced her storytelling style, emphasizing action, high-stakes, and ethical complexity. Collins’ work has been celebrated for its compelling characters and moral depth, and continues to spark dialogue around societal issues and our future. She encourages young readers to question authority and to think critically about their roles in shaping society, cementing her legacy as a writer whose works blend thrilling narratives with social commentary.</p>
